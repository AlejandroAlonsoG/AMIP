Error loading configuration from configs/conf_011.yaml: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 16.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 7.75 GiB of which 6.38 MiB is free. Process 2254232 has 5.74 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.57 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 1.44 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 25.74 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
